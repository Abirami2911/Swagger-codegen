Create Swagger API Definition:

Go to the Swagger Editor.
Create or import a Swagger API definition.
Define your API endpoints, request and response objects, and parameters within the Swagger Editor.
Generate Server Code with Swagger Codegen:

In the Swagger Editor, click on "Generate Server".
Choose a Java-based server framework (e.g., Spring Boot) from the available options.
Click "Generate Server" to create server code.
Download the generated code package.
Implement Functionality:

Open the generated code in your preferred Java IDE.
Implement the server functionality based on the generated code.
Customize and extend the code to match your specific requirements and business logic.
Build and Run the Application:

Use a build tool like Maven or Gradle to build the project.
Start the server application within your IDE or using command-line tools.
Testing with Postman or CURL:

Use tools like Postman or CURL to test your REST API.
Send HTTP requests to the generated endpoints (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to interact with your API.
Configure Dependencies:

Ensure that your project's dependencies include libraries for your chosen server framework (e.g., Spring Boot) and any other required dependencies based on your application's logic.
Customization:

Modify the generated code to add custom business logic, error handling, or security features as needed.
Integrate the generated code with your chosen database system (e.g., MongoDB, MySQL) if your application requires database storage.
Deployment:

Deploy your Java-based REST API to a server or cloud environment based on your deployment requirements.
Documentation:

Consider generating API documentation from your Swagger definition using tools like Swagger UI or ReDoc to make your API endpoints accessible and understandable to others.
This process allows you to quickly generate a Java-based REST API from a Swagger definition and then customize it to meet your application's specific needs.
